As   part of your answer,   you   should   also   define,   unpack and explain what sport entertainment   means   and   looks   like   in contemporary times, as well as clearly showcase   how   and/or   why   your   selected   course   topic is fundamental to the creation, circulation and   consumption   of sport   entertainment via your two different sporting examples.
Course Topics (select One only) 
For each of the four options, you   might   consider   some   of   the   following   aspects   for   further examination and   analysis:
1: Local and Global Sport Markets 
Commercial   issues and   implications   (economics,   revenue, sponsorship,   merchandise, commodification, costs, Uber Sport, ‘Disneyfication’) as well as the   impacts of   the   local/global   (globalisation,   nationalism   and the   nation, travel and/or tourism, locations,markets, access,   revenue, global and   local competitions)   . See   Week   2
2. Sport as Media, Technology and Innovation 
The   role and   impact of the   media   and technologies   (media   representations, the spectacle, social   media access, digital technologies and   innovations,   TV   vs   streaming;   broadcasting/media   rights and forms of   revenue; Twitch and   Gaming,   new   media technologies, emerging   innovations and futuristic developments). See   Week   3
3. Sport Stars as Entertainers 
The   role and   impact of   media fame, stardom and   celebrity   (conditions   for   sport stardom, significance of   local/global celebrity, star   power,   star   performances   and   as performers, as   influencers via social and digital   media   platforms,   significance   of fame   and crossovers with other entertainment   industries,   celebrity endorsements   and sponsorship). See   Week   4
4. Sport as Sustainable Entertainment Issues of sustainability   (environmental   impacts, ecological   protections and   planning,   sustainable futures, economic transparency and feasibility, social   consciousness   and   being socially   responsible, contemporary   issues and concerns –   such   as greenwashing and/or sportswashing). See Week   5
Note: Your   response   needs   to   be driven by a focus on how the course topic (eg   the role of   local and global   markets OR the   role of   the   media, OR the   role   of   celebrity, OR the   role of sustainability) has influenced aspects of contemporary sport entertainment in relation to the two different sports rather than   produce   an   account   solely focused on the sports   themselves. 
*Please clearly identify both your selected course topic and the two specific sporting examples that are being analysed 
Two different sporting examples: Please ensure two different sports are   drawn   upon   to   further   illuminate   how      entertainment   is often   not generic   but,   rather, operates   in different ways   and   different contexts to   ideally embellish and enhance   the   experiences   and entertainment values of the selected sports. Of   course,   conversely,   you   might   argue   that these approaches to entertainment are,   in fact,   too   generic   and   need   to   be more original and   more carefully tailored to the   specific   sport   as they   can   become repetitive, cliched and stale. While you   might   have   a   number   of   poignant   examples   for one sport   (eg football or cricket)   and   should   trace   these,   do   ensure   a   second different sporting example   is also   provided to offer   elements   of   compare   and   contrast.
*Please also look at assessment two to consider what case study and sport(s) you might analysis there, particularly to avoid repetition across both assignments. That is, assignment one and assignment two should avoid repeating the same content and focus (eg two essays on the NBA, EPL etc)*

-          Signpost   your essay: briefly outline   you what   you   will   discuss, highlighting   your main topics/points of discussion.
2. Sport Entertainment Analysis (1500-2000 words approx.) 
Critically evaluate and address the set   question   by   responding   to the   following statement: ‘for any contemporary sport to remain relevant, it must be entertaining’. As   noted earlier,your   response   needs to   be   driven   by a focus on   how the   course topic   (eg   the   role   of   local   and   global   markets OR the   role   of   the   media, OR the   role   of celebrity, OR the   role of sustainability)   has   influenced aspects of   contemporary   sport      entertainment   in   relation to two different sporting examples. 
This section should clearly identify and establish the   relationship   between   your course topic, sport entertainment and your two   different   sport   examples. As   part   of      your answer, you should also define, unpack and explain what sport entertainment means and   looks   like   in contemporary times   in   relation to your specific   analysis. 
Structurally, you   might choose to   provide separate sections for   each   sport,   or   to merge   both   in your account shaped around   particular themes,   concepts   and/or developments.   Regardless, your sport entertainment analysis should   highlight   and probe elements that compare and contrast the two different sporting examples in   relation to your course topic and contemporary   sport   entertainment. 
Your discussion may consider some of the following: 
-          In   what   ways   do   your   sport   examples   attempt   to   ‘entertain’   you?
-          How   is   entertainment   a   feature   of   the   live   experience   –   at   the   event,   at   the venue, around   pre/post event activities,   promotions and/or   activations?
-          How   do   both   local   and   global   audiences   experience   and   engage   with   its entertainment   features – eg   via   media, commerce, celebrity,   etc?
-          Are   other   entertainment   industries   incorporated, featured,   replicated   or   drawn   upon?   In what ways do they   influence the forms   of   entertainment that   are provided?
-         Are themes   pertaining to the environment, sustainability   or social   issues   part   of   the entertainment   package on   offer?
-          How   have your sporting examples evolved,   developed   or   innovated   via your   specific course topic to   be   more entertaining?
NOTE: Please ensure you   have clearly defined and   unpacked   what   contemporary sport entertainment   means while showcasing   how this applies to your   course topic   and two different sporting examples. You   should   also   be   relating your   analysis   back to appropriate course themes and   ideas, as   well   as   key   concepts,   research   and approaches encountered   in the academic   literature   (readings/scholarly sources)   .
3. Conclusion (approx. 250 words): In   this   section   you   should:
-          Summarise   the main points   from   your essay, ensuring   that   the major ideas are covered clearly and   succinctly.
-             Relate the   conclusion   back to your   introduction   and,   more   importantly,   the   essay   theme/topic.
-  Do not introduce   any   new   ideas   or   arguments.
4: References 
- Provide   a   separate   reference   list   of   the   academic   sources   you   have   consulted.
- Ensure you   have consulted and   referenced four academic references in APA format
